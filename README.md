This project aims to help those who can't read or have problems dealing with technologies. It was part of a hackathon organized by TAIL, Music.ai, ARIA, and Moises.

This is a WhatsApp Chatbot that uses Music.ai, OpenAI, and Twilio API to interpret text messages for people who can't read and deliver this interpretation as an audio message. It can also assist people in using the WhatsApp app.
